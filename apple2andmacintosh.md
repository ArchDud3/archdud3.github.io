## Apple II
On April 1, 1976 a little-known company called Apple computer was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. It had no products, but that didn't discourage them. So on April 11, 1976 Steve jobs launched his first computer with his highschool friend, Steve Wozniak. It was called the apple I and it was a simple logic board made in a garage from selling Jobs' minibus and Wozniak's programmable calculator. But there were many problems with this. For one, it was too cheap and was encased in wood that might start a fire. It also didn't have colour graphics, that was essential for certain workloads. So wozniak decided to add some improvements and thus... The apple II was created by Wozniak! This time it had colour graphics, it had a plastic shell, it had an intergrated keyboard and it also had expansion for the first time in a computer! It had specs ahead of it's time and now had 4KB of system memeory with a 1 mHz processor. With the success of the Apple II, they added multiple other versions to the apple II lineup. There was the II plus, IIe, IIe enhanced and IIe Platinum. They even went as far as making an apple III! (Unfortunately the apple III was subject to overheating and was brought off the market.) But since the trend for games was up and machines with better graphics like the coomodore 64 were beating the apple II in games. So Steve Wozniak was designing a 16-bit version of the apple II with better graphics and better sound. This was called the Apple IIGS.

#### The Apple lisa
Jobs had an idea for the next industry-standard machine in 1979 from seeing the Xerox Alto in Palo Alto because he wanted to make a computer with a GUI (Graphical user interface) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. But he was kicked from the development team because his ideas were too broad and unachievable.

## Macintosh
But later in 1979 Jobs decided he didn't want to let his ideas go to waste. He knew he wanted to make a fast, cheap and reliable computer accessable to anyone. He named it the Macintosh, after Jeff Raskin's (Somebody on Jobs' side) favourite type of apples, the McIntosh. In 1983 Jobs had made the Fortune 500 and later that year he recruited John Sculley from PepsiCo. He said *Do you want to sell sugar water for all your life?* and Sculley was hired into Apple Computer inc. But John was on the Lisa team. He said that the Macintosh was just a "Personification of Jobs himself." But they persisted. In 1984 Apple delivered an interesting [advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA) on the super bowl about the release of Macintosh and how 1984 won't be like 1984. Then on Janurary 24, 1984 hundreds of people lined up to see Jobs show off his new machine. He put a canvas bag on a table and Jobs with an eager smile, opened the bag, pulled out a floppy disk from his coat and said "Today, For the first time ever, i'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself." Macintosh then said in a monotone voice "Hello. I am macintosh. It sure is great to get out of that bag. Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I'd like to share with you a maxim I thought of the first time I met an IBM mainframe. NEVER TRUST A COMPUTER YOU CAN'T LIFT! Obviously, I can talk, but right now I'd like to sit back and listen. So, it is with considerable pride that I introduce a man who's been like a father to me... STEVE JOBS." For most of the people at the convention it was almost like Apple had made something sentient, that was only achievable in something like the jetsons. But Jobs didn't just stop there, and that was the reasoning behind why he was kicked from board in 1985.
