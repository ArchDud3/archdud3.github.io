## Apple II
On April 1, 1976 a little-known company called Apple computer was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. It had no products, but that didn't discourage them. So on April 11, 1976 Steve jobs launched his first computer with his highschool friend, Steve Wozniak. It was called the apple I and it was a simple logic board made in a garage from selling Jobs' minibus and Wozniak's programmable calculator. But there were many problems with this. For one, it was too cheap and was encased in wood that might start a fire. It also didn't have colour graphics, that was essential for certain workloads. So wozniak decided to add some improvements and thus... The apple II was born! This time it had colour graphics, it had a plastic shell, it had an intergrated keyboard and it also had expansion for the first time in a computer! This had shown that Jobs was one of the first to realise that a computer could be for anyone.
