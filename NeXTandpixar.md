## NeXT
In 1985 Apple Computer was split with team Sculley and team Jobs. But with Jobs fired from his own company Team Jobs had nowhere else to go apart from Jobs' dreams. Then in 1988, Steve Jobs founded NeXT Systems. This company operated in a quirky way, with a weird way of hiring staff. Jobs hand-picked a few employees from team Jobs that were loyal to him or helped with the making of the Macintosh. There was also a weird way of paychecks, too. If you worked for Jobs before 1985, then you were paid $75,000 USD a year (Equivalent to $150,000 today) but if you started working for Jobs after 1985, then you were paid $55,000 USD a year (Equivalent to $100,000 today). The first ever request that Jobs had while in NeXT was from a chemistry professor called Paul Burg for a 3M workstation for the purpose of higher education use with a megabyte of RAM, a megaFLOP of performance, and a display with a resolution of 1200 by 900, or one megapixel. One megabyte of RAM, a megaFLOP chip, and a megapixel display, hence the name 3M. This workstation ran the first beta of NeXT's Operating system, called NeXTSTEP and Jobs decided to call the 3M workstation... The NeXT computer.
