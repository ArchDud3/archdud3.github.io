                    SkibiOS is an open-source operating system developed by... me! It is free and open-source,
                    and is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/SkibiOS">GitHub.</a><br> SkibiOS comes in five different
                    versions: Regular, ARM, Pro, Minimal and Lite, being a more complex model than<br> linux operating sytems
                    but still less complex than the Microsoft, with Pro being priced at $2.50 per twenty-five licenses.<br> But
                    the main feature of SkibiOS is... the anyapp app, which allows you to use an app image from any operating<br>
                    system (e.g. .exe file) on SkibiOS! It is still in the concept phase, so a lot of ideas are being created and 
                    removed <br> from this world, but while you are faiting you can check out the official website at <a href="https://skibios.github.io">skibios.github.io.</a>
