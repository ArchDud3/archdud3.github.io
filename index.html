                    of software development.<br><br>Anyways, ArchDud3 usually commits at least once a week, and the weeks that he doesn't
                    commit are when he is doing something funky that would be released from the timezone of a few weeks to a few years.

                    the main feature of SkibiOS is... the anyapp app, which allows you to use an app image from any operating
                    system (e.g. .exe file) on SkibiOS! It is still in the concept phase, so a lot of ideas are being created and

                    but he is thinking of evolving his content into more "homemade" gaming, or just making games like my <a href="project-sponge">
